                    I’m a dedicated JavaScript and MERN Stack developer with a strong focus on writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, challenging assumptions, and thinking critically to find the most practical solution. Over time, I’ve developed solid experience with React, Redux (manual & Toolkit), Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and modern frontend practices including responsive UI, animations, and component-based design.

                    I love learning deeply — not just using a tool, but understanding how it works. Whether it's exploring advanced JavaScript concepts, optimizing frontend performance, or designing structured state management, I approach everything with curiosity and precision. I enjoy building real-world projects, improving UI/UX, and continuously refining my workflow.

                    I’m also passionate about personal growth and clear communication. I ask questions, test ideas, and appreciate strong, logical reasoning — qualities that help me deliver high-quality work in fast-paced environments.

                    I’m always exploring new technologies, improving my craft, and building meaningful digital experiences that feel smooth, modern, and user-friendly.

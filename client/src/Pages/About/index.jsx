                    I’m a MERN stack developer who enjoys building clean,
                    functional, and user-friendly web apps. I work mainly
                    with React, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB. I like solving
                    problems, improving UI/UX, and writing code that’s simple,
                    clear, and scalable. I’m always learning new techniques and
                    improving my workflow to build better digital experiences.
